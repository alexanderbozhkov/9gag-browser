I WAS BORED, so ...

I decided that I am tired of always copying and pasting the links for my favorite memes
so I've created a gui that will automatically login in 9gag for me and open my favorite memes 1 by 1.

Stack:
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Python 3.6.7
- the gui is on pyqt5
- selenium for the login navigation and clicking
- chromedriver for selenium ( https://tecadmin.net/setup-selenium-chromedriver-on-ubuntu/ )

TODO: I will try to compile it on binary executable and provide a link if I don't forget.
