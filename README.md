I WAS BORED, so ...

I decided that I am tired of always copying and pasting the links for my favorite memes
so I've created a gui that will automatically login in 9gag for me and scroll through my faborite memes one by one
or just pick a random one.

Stack:
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Python 3.6.7
- project is build with fbs
- the gui is on pyqt5
- selenium for the login navigation and clicking
- chromedriver for selenium ( https://tecadmin.net/setup-selenium-chromedriver-on-ubuntu/ )

Run project:
- on src/ level
- fbs run

Freeze (create executable)
- on src/ level
- fbs freeze
This will create target/ directory with the project in executable format;
